### Hello and welcome!

My name is Tyler Alesse, I am a student at the University of Illinois in Chicago, studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering.
I've spent a little time working with a lot of technologies and languages, but ultimately my passion is problem solving.

## My focus
While I am in school, I don't have as much time to work on large side projects, but I do have small things here and there that I had fun with!

## Iâ€™m currently learning:
Java, x86-64 Assembly, and C

## How to reach me:
You can contact me at TylerAlesse@gmail.com if you want to chat about... well about anything!

## Fun fact:
I hate fun facts.
